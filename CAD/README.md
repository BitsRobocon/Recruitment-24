- Create an autodesk account with your bits email address.
- Look for the option to download fusion 360. Make sure you are downloading the education version of the application. (The link above should guide you to the education page.)
## Task

To design a quadcopter using generative design to reduce material wastage and weight, we can follow these steps:
-Define the requirements and constraints of the design: 
1. The design should be compatible with the Emax R2205 2300KV motor.The design should have enough main body space to fit a 4S 10000mAh battery, flight controller, and GPS
2. The design should be lightweight to improve flight performance and reduce material wastage.
3. The design should be dimensionally close to any standard drone frame ( to ensure compatibility with existing parts.

-Create a 3D model of the quadcopter frame with the specified dimensions and constraints. The design can be created in any CAD software, such as Fusion 360 (preferably), Solidworks, Creo etc.
-Define the material properties and desired load conditions for the generative design optimization.
-Evaluate the generated design options and select the most suitable one based on its performance and manufacturability. The selected design should have minimal material wastage and weight, while still meeting the required performance specifications.
-Finalize the design by adding details such as mounting holes for the motors and other components, and refine the design for ease of 3D printing.
