# Robocon Recruitment'23



We know that the task looks overwhelming, but try to do as much as you can, not compulasory to finish it all but try to do perfectly whichever part you are going to complete . Also considering many issues related to coding, in every script you write, at the start in a commented section, do mention your name,ID, and a brief explaination of the algorithms/code you were going to write, a pseudo-code of sorts. This way, we can leave aside any small annoying debugging issues you may have had, but also get a better understanding of your approach/cocepts and way of thought, despite of whether you were able to implement it or not code wise
