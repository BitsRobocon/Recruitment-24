# Path Planning

A massive earthquake has stricken Pilani at night. The town was mostly deserted, except for a huge factory that was set up there. The entire night shift was working in the control room of the factory, which is where they are trapped now. The workers need to be rescued immediately! Even though the blueprint of the factory is available, the conventional routes might be blocked due to debris and unconventional routes might have opened up. The entire factory has been plunged into darkness and it would be difficult to navigate through the wreckage by humans (not to mention risky!). Authorities turn to the students of BITS Pilani for their assistance. The students decide to deploy a search bot (equipped with a LIDAR scanner) to navigate and find the path from the entrance to the control room. After finding the path, it will send the directions to a medical bot (it has no means of navigating or detecting anything on its own) to follow and reach the control room.     

## Your task is as follows:

1. The map is represented as a 2D list of integers. Each grid is represented by an integer which is a number from 0-15 and represents the walls adjacent to that cell in the Top-Left-Right-Bottom convention with values as 8-4-2-1. Basically, a grid with say, top and bottom walls only will have value = 8(top) + 1(bottom) = 9. This is done to emulate the real-world maze, where the robot can only see the walls of the position it is on currently. You need to make and implement an algorithm, which will decide the direction of movement of the search bot and find the required path. The bot can only move up, down, left or right. You should finally output an integer list containing the final directions that the medical bot can follow (grid by grid) to reach its goal. Represent going up,down,left and right as 0,1,2 and 3 respectively. Assume the bot straightens itself to its original orientation every time it goes one grid to the left or right.

 


# Building a Maze solving system.

This task involves making a path planning algorithm.
## Getting acquainted with python
You can start off by following videos of this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7
This is just an example and thereâ€™s tons of resources available online to learn Python and clarify your doubts. 

Feel free to ask any doubts if youâ€™re unable to find solutions online!

## Install tkinter

Tkinter is a python library that is used to visualize the map,check the following link to install the librar.
Tkinter comes pre-installed with the Python installer binaries for Mac OS X and the Windows platform. So if you install Python from the official binaries for Mac OS X or Windows platform, you are good to go with Tkinter.

For Debian versions of Linux you have to install it manually
Follow this tutorial and you should be set - https://riptutorial.com/tkinter/example/3206/installation-or-setup

## Setup the provided package

The task is going to be performed on the path_planning package given in this repository.
Then, run the pathplannernode.py

If everything has been installed properly, you'll see the following tkinter window pop up -

![tkinter_start_screen](images/start_screen.png)

Here, the blue box represents the cell currently occupied by the bot and the green box represents the final position. The walls in the map are not shown yet, since the robot hasn't been to those cells and hence doesn't know about them.

## Your Evaluative Task

So the package provided has the following files -

### maps

Currently one map (map1.txt) is provided for you to test your algorithm on, but you are free to make more.

Each map file has the following format -
```bash
map_width map_height
start_coord_x start_coord_y end_coord_x end_coord_y
< array representing map walls >
```


### scripts

This contains all the scripts required to complete the task.

 - ##### MapClass.py

    This file contains the data structure used for the map of the maze.

    The map is represented as an array of integers. Each integer is a number from 0-15 and represents the walls adjacent to that cell in Top-Left-Right-Bottom convention with values as 8-4-2-1

    Basically a square with say top and bottom walls only will have value = 8(top) + 1(bottom) = 9

- ##### MapNode.py

   This file provides a graphic interface using the map.

   The direction_callback() function takes the direction of movement as input and moves the robot in that direction. Before making these changes, it checks whether movement in that direction is feasible.
      
- ##### PlannerNode.py

  This file is where you'll be doing all of your work. You have been provided with template code. You need to make and implement an algorithm, which will decide the direction of movement of the robot.

  Some things to keep in mind -

  - It is guaranteed that the bottom direction will be the first step the robot has to take and this is already implemented in the script as an example.
  - You cannot access the map directly.
  - You will be judged on efficiency of your algorithm, so make sure to think the problem through well.

Apart from this, feel free to scout the entire net for whatever resources that you may think are useful to you.


`ðŸ˜ƒ We know that the task looks overwhelming but try to do as much as you can, not compulasory to finish it all but try to do perfectly whichever part you are going to complete  ðŸ˜ƒ  `
